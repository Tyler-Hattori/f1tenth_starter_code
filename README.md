## Code Template

This is what your file system should look like on the Jetson:
```
f1tenth/  # In online ROS tutorials, this folder is called your "catkin workspace"
|    build/
|    |
|    devel/
|    |
|    src/
|    |    pathing_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
|    |    lidar_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
|    |    vesc_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
```
