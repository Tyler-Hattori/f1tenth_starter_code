# UCSB F1TENTH Capstone Project 2024-25
## Code Template

This repository serves as a template that shows how your ROS code should be structured. 

This is what your file system should look like on the Jetson:
```
f1tenth/  # This folder is called your "catkin workspace"
|    build/
|    |
|    devel/
|    |
|    src/ # contains all your packages
|    |    simulator_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
|    |    lidar_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
|    |    vesc_package/
|    |    |
|    |    |
|    |    CMakeLists.txt # compiles your code
```
